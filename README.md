# Statistical Analysis Project: Consumer Behavior & Medical Data

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates applied statistical analysis using Excel to analyze consumer purchasing patterns and medical outcomes data. The assignment covers multiple analytical techniques and statistical testing methods.

##  Objectives
- Analyze station wagon purchasing decisions based on family demographics
- Evaluate hospital patient outcomes by risk categories
- Apply various statistical methods and hypothesis testing
- Generate actionable insights from categorical and numerical data

##  Dataset Information
- **Q1**: Station Wagon Purchase Analysis - Family demographics vs. purchasing decisions (343 records)
- **Q2**: Heart Attack Patient Outcomes - Hospital performance comparison (403 patients)
- **Q3**: Geographic Distance Calculator - US city coordinate analysis (20+ cities)
- **Q4**: Baseball Salary Analysis - Player compensation data with sorting algorithms
- **Q5**: Multi-method Data Processing - Advanced Excel function applications
- **Q6-Q8**: Sales Data Analytics - Product performance and customer analysis

##  Tools & Technologies
